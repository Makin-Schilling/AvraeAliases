When he found the chance to get a quick and easy job, Emmeth took it and unknowingly became the courier for a crime group. Escaping during a failed attempt at a heist, Emmeth went to Ae'Brinthil to start a new life."

-f "Boon Aquisition|After years Emmeth finally returned to Orovion to see his mother and bring her to Ae'Brinthil, ready to give her a new life. He soon learned that before he could do that, he needed to assist his deadbeat father with a hitlist given to him when his mother and father were Eladrin. After focusing a man named \"The Dragon\", Emmeth had to eat a Jinx Fruit and gained some interesting powers that he used to take down the seller and bring his mother to his new home."
